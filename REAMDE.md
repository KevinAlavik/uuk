# uuk
un-named useless kernel

## Note
uuk only supports amd64 and will only ever support amd64

## Building
Building uuk requires a valid GNU toolchain which can produce x86_64-elf and cmake. Building on windows is supported but it might require the use of the toolchain file **uuk.cmake** and you are still required to get a toolchain for x86_64 ELF (GNU).
